Take your first steps with the OpenAI API.
:::

The OpenAI API provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art AI [models](/docs/models) for text generation, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. This example generates [text output](/docs/guides/text) from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com).

Generate text from a model

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    messages: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.",
        },
    ],
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```
