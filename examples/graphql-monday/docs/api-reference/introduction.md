Object types are divided into individual documents within the three categories. Each document explains the object, supported queries and mutations, and their corresponding fields and arguments.

The documents are listed alphabetically in the left-side menu. There, you will also find a column types reference that walks through each supported column type and its functionality.

All other utility types and enums are listed in a separate document within their respective categories:

* Marketplace API reference other types
* Emails & Activities API reference other types
* API reference other types
