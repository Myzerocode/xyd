## Introduction
XYD is a framework for building ambitious docs easier for everyone. </br></br> Meet XYD's principles:

- **Developer Eperience** - designed to be easy to use, with a focus on developer experience. Just put content files and XYD will do the rest.

- **Customization** - customize every part of your documentation. From the layout, to the colors, to the custom logic.

- **Built-in Standards** - content management, components, integrations and much more are built-in with a seamless API you can access.

- **Ecosystem** - modern documentations are more than just a collection of pages. They are a living ecosystem of content, tools, and integrations.
