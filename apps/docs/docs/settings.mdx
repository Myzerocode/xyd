# Settings
:::subtitle
Configure your documentation using the configuration file
:::

The settings file is the central configuration hub for your documentation.
You can use either `settings.json` for a simple configuration or `settings.tsx` if you prefer a more dynamic React-based approach.
:::callout
    React-based configuration is useful if you'd like to use jsx to customize the configuration.
:::

This configuration file controls the look and feel of your documentation, including navigation structure, integrations, analytics tracking, and custom behaviors.

:::callout
    Source code of `settings` is available [here](https://github.com/livesession/xyd/blob/master/packages/xyd-core/src/types/settings.ts)

## Validation
The `settings.json` file is validated against a JSON schema to ensure proper configuration. You can reference the schema by including:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://xyd.dev/schema.json"
}
```

if you use React approuch you can do:
```tsx
import { Settings } from 'xyd-js';

export default {
    // ... your settings configuration here
} satisfies Settings
```
