# Customization Introduction

Learn the fundamentals of documentation customization

Customizing your documentation allows you to create a unique and branded experience for your users.
There are three main approaches for customization:

1. Customization via settings file - choose from a variety of [pre-built themes](/docs/guides/themes) 
and tweak using available [theme settings](/docs/guides/theme-settings)

2. Extending the default theme - build upon the existing design while adding your own enhancements via code

3. Creating a new theme - develop a completely new theme from scratch via code

## Customization via Settings file
This is the simplest way to customize your documentation.
 You can do this by editing the `xyd.json` file in the root of your project.

```json
{
    "theme": {
        "name": "poetry",
        "logo": "/path/to/logo.svg",
        "favicon": "/path/to/favicon.svg",
        // ... other theme settings
    }
}
```
For more details on the theme settings, see the [Theme Settings](/docs/guides/theme-settings) guide.

## Customization via Code
To customize your documentation via code, you'll need to work with a `.xyd/theme` directory inside your project root:
```
.
├─ docs                # project root
│  ├─ .xyd
│  │  └─ theme
│  │     ├─ index.ts   # theme entry
│  │     └─ index.css  # theme styles entry
│  │  
│  └─ index.md
└─ xyd.json            # settings file
```

<code>xyd</code> will lookup for `index.ts` if you want to modify or create new theme behavior. 
This file is only necessary when you need to extend default theme's functionality or create a new theme:

```ts
import {BaseTheme, type Theme} from "xyd-js/themes"

export default class MyTheme extends BaseTheme {
    constructor(theme: Theme) {
        super();

        // you can access theme settings here
    }
}
```

However, if you only want to customize styles, you can simply use `index.css` without creating an `index.ts` file.

## Theme Interface

Theme settings are defined as an object with the following interface:

@importCode "../../../../packages/xyd-core/src/types/settings.ts#Theme"
