# Customization Introduction

Learn the fundamentals of documentation customization

Customizing your documentation allows you to create a unique and branded experience for your users. There are three main approaches to customization:

1. Use built-in themes - choose from a variety of [pre-built themes](/docs/guides/themes) 
and tweak using available [theme settings](/docs/guides/theme-settings)
2. Extend the default theme via code - build upon the existing design while adding your own enhancements using code
3. Create a custom theme - develop a completely new theme from scratch

## Theme Structure
To customize your documentation, you'll need to create a theme entry file in the `.xyd/theme` directory:

```
.
├─ docs                # project root
│  ├─ .xyd
│  │  └─ theme
│  │     ├─ index.ts   # theme entry
│  │     └─ index.css  # theme styles (optional)
│  │  
│  └─ index.md
└─ xyd.json            # settings file
```

When <code>xyd</code> detects the presence of a theme entry file, it will automatically use your custom theme
instead of the default one. This allows you to take full control of your documentation's appearance and behavior.

For more advanced customizations, you can [extend the default theme](/docs/guides/extending-default-theme)
or [create a custom theme](/docs/guides/custom-theme) from scratch.

## Theme Interface


```ts
import { BaseTheme, type ThemeSettings } from "xyd-js/themes";

export default class MyTheme extends BaseTheme {
    constructor(themeSettings: ThemeSettings) {
        super();

        // Customize the theme settings here
    }
}
```
