# Why `xyd`?

Welcome to `xyd`, the documentation platform built for developers who value simplicity and power. We're redefining the documentation experience by making it intuitive, flexible, and enjoyable.

## Features at a Glance

`xyd` is an all-in-one platform with everything needed to create beautiful, functional documentation:

- **[Modern Development](/docs/guides/quickstart)**: Built with Node.js, featuring hot reloading and a developer-friendly CLI
- **[Rich Components](/docs/components)**: Pre-built elements like Guide Cards, Callouts, and interactive Code Samples
- **[Flexible Theming](/docs/guides/themes)**: Customize your site's appearance with our intuitive theming system
- **[API Documentation](/docs/guides/graphql)**: First-class support for GraphQL and OpenAPI specifications
- **[Markdown Extensions](/docs/guides/markdown-extensions)**: Enhanced content creation with advanced formatting options

## Developer-First Philosophy

We've designed `xyd` with developers at the center of our thinking. Documentation should be as enjoyable to create as it is helpful to read.

The CLI-first approach gets you started with just a few commands—no complex configuration files or steep learning curves. Write in Markdown and let `xyd` handle the rest. With hot reloading, see your changes instantly as you work, making the development process smooth and efficient.

## Content-Rich Architecture

Unlike traditional site generators that prioritize technical aspects, `xyd` puts your content first. We've built the platform with a focus on typography, readability, and user experience to ensure your documentation effectively communicates with readers.

Our component system enhances your content rather than overshadowing it. From interactive code samples with live editing to executable snippets that demonstrate functionality in real-time, `xyd` provides everything needed to make your documentation both engaging and informative. Users can experiment with code directly in the browser, seeing results instantly without leaving your documentation.

## API Documentation Excellence

`xyd` delivers exceptional API documentation through comprehensive integration capabilities that make documenting APIs straightforward and maintainable. Our approach to API documentation focuses on accuracy, readability, and developer experience to ensure that your API documentation remains a reliable resource for your users.

### Automatic Documentation Generation

The platform leverages your existing codebase to generate accurate and comprehensive documentation automatically, ensuring your documentation always reflects your current implementation:

- **[GraphQL Schema](/docs/guides/graphql)**: Import your GraphQL schema and `xyd` will generate complete documentation with detailed type information, queries, mutations, and examples. The system automatically identifies relationships between types and presents them in a way that's easy to understand.

- **[OpenAPI/Swagger](/docs/guides/openapi)**: Connect your OpenAPI or Swagger specifications to create beautiful, structured API documentation. `xyd` transforms technical specifications into user-friendly documentation with organized endpoints, parameter details, and formatted response examples that help users quickly understand how to interact with your API.

- **[TypeScript Definitions](/docs/guides/typescript)**: Generate documentation directly from your TypeScript type definitions and interfaces. This approach ensures your documentation stays synchronized with your code as it evolves, reducing maintenance overhead and eliminating documentation drift.

### Customizable API Reference Pages

The platform provides robust tools for creating custom API reference pages that meet your specific documentation needs:

- **Custom Endpoint Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for each API endpoint with customizable sections for parameters, request examples, response formats, and error handling.

- **Versioning Support**: Maintain documentation for multiple API versions side by side, making it easy for users to find information relevant to the version they're using.

- **Code Sample Generation**: Automatically generate code samples in multiple programming languages to show how to interact with your API, helping users quickly implement your API in their preferred language.

## Simplified for Developers. Built for Everyone.

We've streamlined the entire documentation process—from writing and reviewing to publishing and maintaining. Our API-first approach with extensive customization options means you can tailor `xyd` to your specific requirements.

Whether building a simple documentation site or a complex developer portal, `xyd` offers the flexibility to meet your needs while removing unnecessary complexity.
