# Extending the default theme
:::subtitle
Learn how to extend the default theme to match your brand.
:::

VitePress' default theme is optimized for documentation, and can be customized. Consult the Default Theme Config Overview for a comprehensive list of options.

However, there are a number of cases where configuration alone won't be enough. For example:

You need to tweak the CSS styling;
You need to modify the Vue app instance, for example to register global components;
You need to inject custom content into the theme via layout slots.
These advanced customizations will require using a custom theme that "extends" the default theme.
