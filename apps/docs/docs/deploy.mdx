# Deploy your `xyd` docs
:::subtitle
Learn how to make your docs available to the public
:::

* The <code>xyd</code> site is inside the docs directory of your project.

* You are using the default build output directory (.xyd/build).

* <code>xyd</code> CLI is installed on your computer.

## Build and test

:::steps
* Run this command to build the docs:
    <br/>
    ```bash
    $ xyd build
    ```

* Once built, preview it locally by running:
    <br/>
    ```bash
    $ xyd start
    ```

* You can also configure the port of the server by passing --port as an argument.
    <br/>
    ```bash
    $ xyd start --port 3000
    ```
    <br/>
    Now you can visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)` to see the preview.
