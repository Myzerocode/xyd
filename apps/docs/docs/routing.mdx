##  File-Convention Routing

<code>xyd</code> uses file-convention routing by default, which means the generated HTML pages
are mapped from the directory structure of the source Markdown files. 
 
For example, given the following directory structure:

```
.
├ docs
│  └─ index.md
│  └─ quickstart.md
|
├─ index.md
├─ faq.md
|
└─ settings.json
```

The generated HTML pages will be:
```
index.md                  --> /index.html (accessible as /)
faq.md                    --> /faq.html
docs/index.md            -->  /docs/index.html (accessible as /docs/)
quickstart.md             --> /quickstart.html
```

:::callout
File-convention routing is powerful because you don't need any configuration but also has some limitations. 
<br/>
If you need more control over the routing, you can use the [`settings`](#) file to customize the routing.
:::

## Settings-Based Routing

You can customize the routing by adding a routes in `settings.json|settings.tsx` file to your project.

The `navigation` property controls the hierarchy of your documentation. It's grouped into multiple properties:

* [`sidebar`](#sidebar) - Main navigation, usually displayed on the left side of the page.
* [`header`](#header) - Sub navigation, usually displayed on the top of the page.
* [`anchors`](#anchors) - Fixed navigation, helpful for displaying a static navigation/links.

:::callout
Dividing a `navigation` into multiple properties helps you to organize your documentation better.
:::

### Sidebar
If you don't want any hierarchy, you can just define pages within your navigation field.

Each entry of the pages array must be a path to a file that exists within your repo.

:::callout
Note you do not need to append .mdx to the file paths.
:::

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "sidebar": [
      "overview",
      "quickstart",
      "guides/introduction"
    ]
  }
}
```
Using this approach we got something funcitonal to [`File-Convention Routing`](/#file-convention-routing) but also have the ability to customize the sidebar more.

#### Groups in Sidebar
Groups allow you to group your pages. Groups can also be nested within each other.

```json
{
  "sidebar": [
    {
        {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": [
                "overview",
                "quickstart",
                "guides/introduction"
            ]
        },
        // ... other groups
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Routing in Sidebar
You can also do more advanced routing in the sidebar, like matching based on the current route.

```json
{
    "sidebar": [
        {
            "match": "docs",
            "items": [
                {
                    "group": "Getting Started",
                    "pages": [
                        "docs/introduction",
                       "docs/components"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "group": "Guides",
                    "pages": [
                        "docs/guides/introduction",
                        "docs/guides/components"
                    ]
                }
            ],
        },
        {
            "match": "docs/api",
            "items": [
                {
                    "group": "API",
                    "pages": [
                        "docs/api/introduction",
                        "docs/api/error-handling",
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
:::callout
This approuch gives you more control over the routing and allows you to create more complex navigation structures.
:::

### Header

The header navigation allows you to create a top-level navigation bar with dropdown menus. 
You can also define a sub header for a specific route.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "header": [
      {
        "name": "Documentation",
        "url": "/docs"
      },
      {
        "name": "API Reference",
        "url": "/docs/api"
      },
      {
        "sub": {
          "match": "/docs/api",
          "name": "API",
          "items": [
            {
              "name": "Getting Started",
              "url": "/docs/api"
            },
            {
              "name": "Authentication",
              "url": "/docs/api/auth"
            },
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "sub": {
          "match": "/docs/guides",
          "name": "Guides",
          "items": [
            {
              "name": "Quick Start",
              "url": "/docs/guides/quickstart"
            },
            {
              "name": "Tutorials",
              "url": "/docs/guides/tutorials"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

:::callout
The `match` property in sub header determines when the dropdown should be visible based on the current route.
:::

### Anchors

Anchors provide a way to add fixed navigation elements, typically at the bottom of the page. They're useful for displaying important external links or resources.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "anchors": {
      "bottom": [
        {
          "icon": "icon-book",
          "name": "Documentation",
          "url": "https://docs.example.com"
        },
        {
          "icon": "icon-users",
          "name": "Community",
          "url": "https://community.example.com"
        },
        {
          "icon": "icon-code",
          "name": "GitHub",
          "url": "https://github.com/example"
        },
        {
          "icon": "icon-chat",
          "name": "Support",
          "url": "https://support.example.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::callout
Anchors support icons and can be positioned at different parts of the page using the `bottom` property.
